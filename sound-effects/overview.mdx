[A short description of Sound Effects]

[layout & settings]

The general layout for sound effects is fairly straightforward you have a window or you're putting a prompt you have some settings and you have a generate button. When you first open the web page you will have a few suggestions below the text box to Showcase what some of the  prompts might look like that you can easily try out.

Now that we are dealing with prompts, it is important to learn some terminology when it comes to audio to get the most out of the feature. You will have to prompt the AI with words and sentences in a way that it understands, and in this case, it understands both natural language and audio terminology.

Here is a short, non-comprehensive list of some words that you might want to learn and try in your prompts.

**Foley:** The process of recreating and recording everyday sound effects like footsteps, movement, and object sounds in sync with the visuals of a film, TV show, or video game to enhance the audio quality and realism.

**Whoosh:** An effect that underscores movement, like a fist flying or a camera move. It's versatile and can range from fast, ghostly, slow-spinning, rhythmic, noisy, and tense.

**Impact:** The sound of an object making contact with another object or structure, like a book falling, a car crashing, or a mug shattering.

**Braam:** A big, brassy, cinematic hit that conveys something epic and grand is about to happen, commonly used in movie trailers.

**Glitch:** The sound of a malfunction, jittering, scratching, skipping, or moving erratically, used for transitions, logo reveals, or sci-fi soundscapes.

**Drone:** A continuous, textured sound that adds atmosphere and suspense, often used to underscore exploration or horror scenes.

Onomatopoeias like "oink", "meow", "roar", and "chirp" are also important sound effects that imitate natural sounds.


## Prompting

[what is prompting?]

We will go through how to construct a good prompt as well as what a prompt is. we will then split these prompts into simple prompts and complex prompts. in general simple prompts are prompting the AI to generate one sound while complex problems is instructing the AI to generate a series of sounds.

### Simple Prompts

Simple prompts are just that: they are simple, one-sided prompts where we try to get the AI to generate a single sound effect. This could be, for example, "person walking on grass" or "glass breaking." These types of prompts will generate sound effects, which might create a multitude of variations either in the same generation or in subsequent generations, but all in all, they are fairly simple.

There are a few ways to improve these prompts, however, and that is by adding a little bit more detail. Even if they are simple prompts, they can be made to give better output by improving the prompt itself. For example, something that sometimes works is adding details like "high-quality, professionally recorded footsteps on grass, sound effects foley." It can require some experimentation to find a good balance between being descriptive and keeping it brief enough to have AI understand the prompt.

  

### Complex Prompts

When talking about complex prompts, we don't mean the length or the adjectives or adverbs used in the prompts. Although those can increase the complexity of the prompt, when we say complex prompts, we mean prompts where you have multiple sound effects or a sequence of sound effects happening in a specific order and AI being able to replicate this.

/>

Let's take the prompt above as an example. The AI needs to understand both what a man walking through the hallway sounds like, as well as what a man falling down some stairs sounds like. It needs to understand the sequence in which these two things are supposed to happen based on how you wrote it, and then combine these sounds to make both of them sound coherent and correct. This is what we mean when we say a complex prompt because it involves both an understanding of sound and an understanding of natural language explaining what you want.

The AI can do this; for example, the result for the example prompt above would hopefully be accurate.

However, in general, this is much more complicated for the AI to do because it is a lot more complex. For the best results, we would recommend generating individual sound effects and then combining them in an audio editor of your choice, like you would with a real production where you have individual sound effects that are then combined.

Regardless, it is a big step for a model like this to be able to understand more nuanced phrasing and prompts, and to understand both the sequence of events as well as the actual sound effects. This makes them coherent and sound like a cohesive scene.


## Settings

Once you've set your prompt and you know what you want to generate, you can jump into the settings. Set how long you want the generated audio to be and how influential the prompt should be to the output.

There are just two settings:

**Duration:** Determine how long your generations should be. Depending on what you set this as, you can get quite different results. For example, if I write "kick drum" and set the length to 11 seconds, I might get a full drum loop with a kick drum in it, but that might not be what I want. On the other hand, if I set the length to 1 second, I might just get a one-shot with a single instance of a kick drum.

**Prompt Influence:** Slide the scale to make your generation perfectly adhere to your prompt or allow for a little creativity. This setting ranges from giving the AI more creativity in how it interprets the prompt to telling the AI to be more strict in following the exact prompt that you've given.


## Beyond Sound Effects

Even if the name of the feature is called "Sound Effects," don't let that fool you. This is the perfect tool for sound designers, Foley artists, game developers, as well as producers and composers. 

If you're a hip-hop producer looking for samples, new or more old school, and are tired of digging in crates or reusing the same overused samples that everyone else uses, this is the perfect tool for you. If you are an EDM producer looking for one-shots or other samples, it's perfect for you as well.

You can generate everything  from Individual one shots to drum Loops to instrumental Loops to Unique new samples  from Big Band sections and Brass stabs pretty much anything you can imagine.

I will go through a little bit of how to prompt this, but it is a lot of trial and error to get what you want.

**Stem:** An individual track from a multitrack recording, such as isolated vocals, drums, or guitar.

**BPM:** Beats per minute, indicating the tempo of a piece of music.

**Key:** The scale in which a piece of music is set, such as C major or A minor.

**Loop:** A repeating section of sound material, commonly used in electronic music.

**Sample:** A portion of sound, typically a recording, used in musical compositions.

**One-shot:** A single, non-repeating sound or sample, often used in percussion.

These terms are, of course, just scratching the surface, as there are things such as synth pads, baselines, chord progressions, arpeggio, and many, many other musical terms that can be good to learn. However, the above can be good to get started with generating musical material.


## Tips and Tricks

This is the first model we've released that takes a prompt and gives an output. Our previous text-to-speech models and speech-to-speech models have taken inputs in the form of text or audio and given an output, but they have not been prompts. This means that the way to work with something like this is slightly different.

Try to keep your prompts concise with as much relevant information as possible, but don't make them overly short because that gives the AI not enough context to create what you want or work optimally.
