# Introduction
[ElevenLabs Text to Speech API](https://elevenlabs.io/api) allows you to convert text into audio files. You can use it to create voice-overs for your videos, to generate audio files for your audiobooks, or to create podcasts.


Here is an example of an audio output:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/audio/output.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /> 
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>
