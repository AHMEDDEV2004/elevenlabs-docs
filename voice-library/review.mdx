## Review

Once youâ€™ve created, named, and shared your voice, it will be set for pending review. This means that someone from the ElevenLabs team will go through your voice to ensure that it adheres to the guidelines outlined above. If there are significant issues, your request to share the voice model will be declined. If only small changes are required, the team might make these adjustments for you and approve the voice model for sharing.  

As part of the review process, our team may add labels to your voice model to make it discoverable using the filters for the Voice Library:

- Gender
- Accent (English accents only for now, others coming later)
- Language (the language of the source audio used to create your PVC, if applicable)
- Age
- Use case
- Descriptive

Consistently uploading voices that do not adhere to the guidelines or are highly explicit in nature might result in being barred from uploading and sharing voices altogether. Therefore, please adhere to the guidelines.  

Currently, we do not have an estimate of how long the review process will take, as it is highly dependent on the length of the queue.
