ElevenLabs offers high-quality pre-made voices, our [Voice Design](voicelab/voice-design) feature for custom creations, and a cloning feature for replicating existing voices.

The Voice Design feature allows users to select gender, age, and accent to generate unique voices. Keep in mind that it may take a few tries to find the perfect fit.

When cloning a voice, it's crucial to consider the AI's training to get a good clone and focus on audio quality over length. Providing clear, well-paced speech of a single voice with consistent volume and without any background noise, chatter, reverb or other effects usually yields better results. Users should be mindful of potential limitations when attempting to clone voices with uncommon accents or highly dynamic speech.

Although any voice can speak any language, it is important to note that the AI will try to mimic the accent of the original voice. So, if you have cloned a voice with an American accent and have it speak Spanish, the generated audio might have an American accent.

### Pre-made Voices

- High-quality, free-to-use voices
- Suitable for most use-cases
- Trained on English voices. Can be used with other languages but might have an English accent

### Generated Voices (Voice Design)

- Custom voice creation with gender, age, and accent options
- Quality comparable to pre-made and cloned voices
- May require multiple attempts to find the desired voice

### Cloned Voices

- Better at replicating more common accents
- Audio quality of samples is crucial for successful cloning
- Good audio length is about 1-2 minutes
- Consistent RMS volume may improve clone quality
- Results can be less predictable with wide dynamic range and broad emotional speech
