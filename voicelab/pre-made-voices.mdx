title: "Pre-made Voices"
description: "Choose from male and female voices for various use-cases. For tailored options, refer to voice settings or read further."
---

There are both male and female voices to choose from, suitable for most use-cases. Although you can adjust the voice settings for some slight variations, if you require a more tailored voice, please see our voice design and voice cloning topics to create entirely custom voices.

Our premade voices are designed to work well with a range of languages. Each voice will have a different style/accent in each language. We highly recommend testing a few out to find the best ones for your language, audience and application.
To help you find your perfect voice, below we've created a mapping table showing the regional accents that each voice exhibits when being used for a particular language. The table also shows the use cases that accent might work well for, as described by native speakers of that language:
