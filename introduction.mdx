This guide will help you get started with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io). We will cover everything, starting with creating an account, and then moving on to cloning your first voice using the [VoiceLab](/../voicelab).

Once you have set up your voices, we will move on to [Speech Synthesis](/../speech-synthesis). Here, you will be able to generate your first audio outputs using the pre-made voices or the ones you've created or cloned.

Moving on, we will also go through [Projects](/../projects), which is our end-to-end solution for creation voiceovers for long-form content such as longer articles or audiobooks with just a few clicks.

We will cover [Dubbing](/../dubbing), which is our automatic solution for creating dubs in any language that the AI supports. It keeps both the original voice and tries to retain the same performance across languages.

We will also touch on prompting techniques (how to influence the AI's performance), as well as its current limitations and challenges and provide some troubleshooting and various tips-and-tricks.


### How does the AI model work?

The AI models has been trained on a vast amount of audio and are suitable for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from more natural and conversational speech to more dramatic audiobook readings. We offer multiple different [models](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/models), each one has been trained differently and has its own strengths.

It is important to note is that the AI understands context. This means that if you write something in the style of a book, the AI will try to interpret how to perform a certain passage from the context of the writing itself. To achieve a wider emotive range, you can lower the [stability](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/voice-settings#stability) slider, although this may sacrifice some degree of predictability.

With each successive update to the model, where it has been re-trained, the AI gets better and better at understanding different contexts as its dataset grows. This will help it understand more nuances between humans, languages, and accents.
