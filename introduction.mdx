This guide will help you get started with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io). We will cover everything, starting with creating an account, and then moving to cloning your first voice and generating your initial voiceover. We will also cover prompting techniques (how to influence the AI's performance) as well as its current limitations and challenges.

We will guide you through the various stages of ElevenLabs, starting with [VoiceLab](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-lab); this is where you can create or clone voices according to your preferences. Once you have set up your desired voices, we will move on to [Speech Synthesis](https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis). Here, you will be able to generate your first audio outputs using the pre-made voices or the ones you've created or cloned.


### How does the AI model work?

The AI models has been trained on a vast amount of audio and are suitable for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from more natural and conversational speech to more dramatic audiobook readings. We offer multiple different [models](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/models), each one has been trained differently and has its own strengths.

It is important to note is that the AI understands context. This means that if you write something in the style of a book, the AI will try to interpret how to perform a certain passage from the context of the writing itself. To achieve a wider emotive range, you can lower the [stability](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/voice-settings#stability) slider, although this may sacrifice some degree of predictability.

With each successive update to the model, where it has been re-trained, the AI gets better and better at understanding different contexts as its dataset grows. This will help it understand more nuances between humans, languages, and accents.
