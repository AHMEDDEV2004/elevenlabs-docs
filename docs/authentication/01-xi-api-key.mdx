In order to use our API you need to get your xi-api-key first. Create an account, log in and then visit https://beta.elevenlabs.io and in the upper
right corner click on your profile picture -> profile.

Next click on the eye icon on your profile to access your xi-api-key. Do not show your account to anyone else, if someone has access to your xi-api-key he
can use your account as he could if he knew your password.

You can generate a new xi-api-key at any time by clicking on the spinning arrows next to the text field. This will invalidate your old xi-api-key.
