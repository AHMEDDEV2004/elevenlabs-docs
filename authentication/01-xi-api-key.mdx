In order to use our API you need to get your `xi-api-key` first.
[Create an account](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/sign-up), log in
and in the upper right corner click on your profile picture -> profile.

</p>

Next click on the eye icon on your profile to access your `xi-api-key`.
Do not show your account to anyone else. If someone gains access to your `xi-api-key`
he can use your account as he could if he knew your password.

You can generate a new `xi-api-key` at any time by clicking on the spinning arrows
next to the text field. This will invalidate your old `xi-api-key`.
