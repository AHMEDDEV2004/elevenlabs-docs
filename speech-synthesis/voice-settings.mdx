Our users have found different workflows that suit them. The one you'll see most often is setting stability around 40 and similarity near 75, with minimal changes thereafter. Of course, this all depends on the quality of the original voice and the style of performance you're aiming for.

For a more lively and dramatic performance, it is recommended to set the stability slider lower and generate a few times until you find a performance you like.

On the other hand, if you want a more serious performance, even bordering on monotone on very high values, it is recommended to set the stability slider higher. And since it's more consistent and stable, you usually don't need to do as many generations to get what you are looking for. Experiment to find what works best for you!

Some users have taken it a step further with the API, making the sliders dynamic based on text length.

It's important to note that the sliders are not deterministic settings; setting them to specific values won't guarantee the same results every time. Instead, the sliders function more as a range, determining how wide the randomization can be between each generation. Setting stability low means a wider range of randomization, often resulting in a more emotive performance, but this is also highly dependent on the voice itself.

Hovering over `!` icon next to the sliders will provide additional information.

## Stability

The stability slider determines how stable the voice is and the randomness of each new generation. Lowering this slider introduces a broader emotional range for the character - this, as mentioned before, is also influenced heavily by the original voice. Setting the slider too low may result in odd performances that are overly random and cause the character to speak too quickly. On the other hand, setting it too high can lead to a monotonous voice with limited emotion.

## Similarity

The similarity slider dictates how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice when attempting to replicate it. If the original audio is of poor quality and the similarity slider is set too high, the AI may reproduce artefacts or background noise when trying to mimic the voice if those were present in the original recording.
