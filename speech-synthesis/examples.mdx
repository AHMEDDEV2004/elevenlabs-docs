In this part, we're highlighting what the AI can do, particularly in expressing a variety of emotions. Keep in mind the following to get similar results:

1. Clone voices tend to have a better emotional range than pre-made or voice-designed ones. So, we often use cloned voices for examples. Interestingly, cloning a voice-designed or a pre-made voice can actually improve its emotional range. Feel free to try this yourself.

2. Lowering stability can make the voice less steady, leading to stronger emotions, especially for intense or unusual performances like screaming. However, the AI is mainly great at narration, its main strength.




## Shouting

> Rising anger, whispering to shouting, "No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!"
