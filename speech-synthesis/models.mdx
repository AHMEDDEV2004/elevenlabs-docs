As of May 2023, the ElevenLabs has two models: `monolingual` and `multilingual`. The monolingual model is the first model released by ElevenLabs, which has only been trained on an English dataset. In contrast, the multilingual model has been trained on a dataset that includes a plethora of other languages, including French, German, Hindi, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. 

The v1 of the multilingual model is still in its experimental stage - there are still [bugs and refinements](/../troubleshooting) that need to be addressed. Nonetheless, for many tasks, it works perfectly well already. Keep in mind that introducing multiple languages also introduces more complexities and potential issues. One of the main things to be mindful of when using the multilingual model is to keep the generations short. Try and keep the text chunks below 800 characters if possible as some of the problems tend to get amplified the longer the generations are.

Regarding the multilingual model, it's worth noting that, just like with the English voices, the AI will try to preserve the accent of the original voice. This applies even when an English voice speaks other languages, and you might hear a slight English accent. All the current pre-made voices are English, and to get the most authentic experience, it appears that cloning voices that speak the language you intend to use the AI for is the best choice. Doing so will ensure that there are minimal foreign accents.
