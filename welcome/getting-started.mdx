## Signing up

You can sign up with Google, Facebook, or with your email. 

If you choose to sign up with your email, you will be asked to verify your email address. Once you have verified your email, you will be directed to the Speech Synthesis page, where you can immediately start using the service. Simply type anything into the box, press "generate," and the AI will vocalize the words you have written. Please note that each time you press "generate" anywhere on the website, it will count towards your quota.


## Subscriptions

Once you sign up, you will be automatically assigned to the free tier. To view your subscriptions, click on the profile picture in the upper right corner and select ["Subscription"](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/subscription).

We offer five public plans: `Free`, `Starter`, `Creator`, `Independent Publisher`, and `Growing Business`. In addition, we also offer a sixth option - `Enterprise` - tailored to the unique needs and usage of our clients.

Each plan details its offerings, including the character limits, the number of custom voices and cloned voices allowed simultaneously and the quality of audio provided. Please note that custom voices and cloned voices have different meanings.

It is important to note that cloning is only available on the `Starter` tier and above. The free plan offers three custom voices, but these are not the same as the custom-cloned voices. Instead, they are custom voices you can create without a voice designer tool.

You can upgrade your subscription at any time, and the unused quota from your last subscription will roll over to the new plan. However, please remember that unused quota does not roll over from month to month; it is an allocated amount for that month only.

From the subscription page, you can also downgrade your subscription at any point in time if you would like. When downgrading, it won't take effect until the current plan elapses, and you won't lose any of the monthly quota before your month is up.

For more information on payment methods, please refer to the [Help Center](https://help.elevenlabs.io/).
