Keep in mind that ElevenLabs is currently in beta and the multilingual model is in its experimental stage. You might get a few strange generations from time to time and there are a few things to keep in mind to get the best possible results.

During generation, the audio may change in tone, quality, introduce noise, and distort, and the voice may transition from male to female or start whispering, and more. The prominence of these issues largely depends on the model and voice used. Currently, the monolingual model handles longer generations better, but we are continuously working on both models to improve this in the future.

We are aware that the voices have a tendency to degrade during longer audio generations, and our team is working hard to develop the technology to improve upon this. As stated above, this issue is more prominent in the experimental multilingual model.

To help mitigate these problems, we recommend breaking down the text into shorter sections, preferably below 800 characters, as this can help maintain better quality. Additionally, if you are using English voices, it is advisable to stick with the monolingual model for now, as it tends to exhibit more stability.

There are a few other factors that could contribute to these issues, and we'd like to highlight some of the key ones:
 
### How long is the text chunk?
The voices do have a tendency to degrade over time. The experimental multilingual model tends to degrade quicker than the monolingual model. The team is currently working hard on finding solutions to these problems.

### Monolingual or Multilingual?
Monolingual is more stable but only officially supports English.
Multilingual is still experimental and can have a few extra quirks that are being worked on.

### Pre-made, voice-designed voices, or cloned voices?
Some of the pre-made voices have a tendency to start whispering during longer generations.
Similar problems have been observed in the voice-designed voices as well, but it is dependent on the voice itself.
If you're using cloned voices, the quality of the samples used is very important to the final output. Noise and other artefacts tend to be amplified during long generations.

### What settings are you using?
Both stability and similarity can change how the voice acts as well as how prominent the artefacts are. Hoovering over the `!` next to each side of the sliders will reveal some more information.
The multilingual model may also mispronounce certain numbers and symbols. For instance, 1, 2, 3 might be pronounced as "one," "two," "three." Therefore, if you need them to be pronounced in another language, it is recommended to write them out.

We acknowledge that these solutions are temporary measures and may not address all concerns perfectly. However, we believe they can be beneficial in specific situations.

Our team is also actively developing new technology to facilitate extremely long generations. One such update is called "projects" and will be released soon.
