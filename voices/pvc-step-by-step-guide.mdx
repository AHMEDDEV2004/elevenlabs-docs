## What is a Professional Voice Clone (PVC)?

A Professional Voice Clone (PVC) is a special feature that is available to our Creator+ plans. A PVC is an ultra-realistic, custom AI model of your voice. This is done by training our specialized model with longer voice data (at least 30 mins and up to 3 hours for optimum results) to make it sound just like the original voice.

Essentially, a PVC is a more advanced version of our Instant Voice Cloning feature. For now, we only allow you to clone your own voice. You will be asked to go through a verification process with our voice Captcha before submitting your fine-tuning request.

Custom AI models require fine-tuning and training, so PVCs will take longer (about 4 to 8 hours) compared to Instant Voice Clones.

3. Confirm that you have read our Guidelines and Rules and click “Start”:

4. Name your PVC, Choose the Language, and Upload your recordings:

5. Add Labels and a Description for your Professional Clone Voice (this can be changed later) and click “Create Professional Voice”:

1. Once the PVC model has accepted all of your Audio Samples, you will then be asked to verify your voice:

Before moving on, ensure that your browser has access to your Microphone and that you are not muted. The AI will compare your voice to the samples you just submitted, so it’s important to use the same equipment that you used to record your uploaded audio samples - try your best to match the tone and delivery!

Once you’re ready, click “Start Recording” and you will see a generated captcha to read such as the following:

If the AI detects a difference in the audio quality of your recordings, you may see an error message letting you know:

Ensure that your audio quality matches your uploaded recordings, speak clearly and concisely, and try again:

Great! Your voice has been verified. Your PVC is now queued for Fine-Tuning:

## Key Considerations and Recording Quality Standards

Whether you’re new to voice recording or a seasoned professional. Here are some quality guidelines to consider. Also, if your audio follows the guidelines listed below, your PVC will earn a High-Quality Badge in our Voice Library, enhancing your ranking and potential earnings!

1. Use at least 30 mins to 3 hours of audio: The bare minimum we recommend is 30 minutes of audio, but for optimal results and the most accurate clone, we recommend closer to 3 hours of audio. This can be either one long file, or several different files. If you choose to upload multiple audio files, make sure they have the same audio quality and are recorded in the same space.
2. Clear audio with a single speaker and no background music or sound effects

Secondly, make sure there’s only a single speaking voice throughout the audio, as more than one speaker or excessive noise or anything of the above can confuse the AI. This confusion can result in the AI being unable to discern which voice to clone or misinterpreting what the voice actually sounds like because it is being masked by other sounds, leading to a less-than-optimal clone.

3. Use Professional Recording Equipment: Use high-quality recording equipment for optimal results. 
4. Microphone Distance: Position yourself at an optimal distance. Too far will sound hollow and faint. Closer is better, but ensure that your volume does not exceed a peak of -12dB. A good rule of thumb is to place yourself approximately two fists away from your microphone.
5. Room Acoustics: Preferably, record in an acoustically-treated room. This reduces unwanted echoes and background noises, leading to clearer audio input for the AI. You can make something temporary using a thick duvet or quilt to dampen the recording space.
6. Volume Control: Maintain a consistent volume that’s loud enough to be clear but not so loud that it causes distortion. The goal is to achieve a balanced and steady audio level. The ideal would be between -23dB and -18dB RMS with a true peak of -3dB.
7. (optional) Audio Pre-processing: Consider editing and improving your audio quality! If you have some audio knowledge or are working with an audio engineer, you might find that adding light Compression or other tools can improve your audio files before creating your PVC. Please note that excessive processing can have diminishing returns, so it’s best to be conservative with these effects.

Other Tips and Tricks 

Please avoid these technical recording issues:

- Room echo or "boxiness.” 
- Background noise, including hiss, white noise, electrical hum, or external disturbances.
- Apparent editing issues (i.e. clicks, pops, audible cuts).
- Distortion, clipping, heavy compression, or excessive processing (i.e. noise gate, noise reduction plugin, normalization, EQ).
- Sibilance, loud breath noises, plosives, and mouth clicks.
- Repeats, mistakes, and long periods of silence (5 seconds or more).
- Voice level/input gain imbalance anywhere in the recording.

Performance guidelines:

- Emphasis, intonations and emotions should align appropriately with the context of the text to create a realistic PVC.
- The speaking style in the samples you provide will be replicated in the output, so depending on what delivery you are looking for, the training data should correspond to that style (e.g. if you are looking to voice an audiobook with a clone of your voice, the audio you submit for training should be a recording of you reading a book in the tone of voice you want to use). It is better to just include one style in the uploaded samples for more consistent results.
- Please vary your tone and pace naturally when reading. ✅
- Please avoid changing voices for different characters in a single recording or else this will create errors in your voice model. ❌
- Ensure correct and articulate pronunciation.
- Avoid sounding nasal, muffled, or wet (excess saliva).

## Scripts

Here’s a variety of English scripts to help you create PVCs optimized for some of the most popular use cases. 

Please remember that what you read is not very important; how you read it is very important, however. The AI will try to mimic everything it hears in a voice: the tonal quality, the accent, the inflection, and many other intricate details. It will replicate how you pronounce certain words, vowels, and consonants, but not the actual words themselves. So, it is better to choose a text or script that conveys the emotion you want to capture, and read in a tone of voice you want to use, and optimized for the use case it’s intended to serve.
